**Completed**: 2025-10-15  
**Implementation**: 800+ lines with 60+ unit tests
**Enhanced**: Resource Well Pressurizer mechanics (2025-10-15)

#### Power Generator System ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT STARTED
- [ ] PowerGenerator struct (distinct from ProductionLine)
- [ ] Generator types: Biomass, Coal, Fuel, Nuclear, Geothermal
- [ ] Fuel consumption vs power generation mapping
- [ ] Overclock support for generators
- [ ] Integration with Factory.power_generators
- [ ] Total power balance calculation (generation - consumption)

**Blockers**: None  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

#### Persistence Layer ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT STARTED
- [ ] Serde Serialize/Deserialize for all types
- [ ] JSON export for entire SatisflowEngine state
- [ ] JSON import with validation
- [ ] Error handling for corrupted saves
- [ ] Schema versioning for future compatibility
- [ ] Migration system for breaking changes

**Blockers**: None  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

### Medium Priority

#### ID Management System ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- [ ] Replace sequential ID generation with UUID
- [ ] Factory ID collision prevention
- [ ] LogisticsFlux ID management
- [ ] ProductionLine ID uniqueness across factories
- [ ] ID persistence across save/load cycles

**Current Issue**: Simple counter can cause ID conflicts  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

#### Validation Layer ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- [x] Overclock range validation (0-250%)
- [x] Sommersloop limit validation
- [ ] Factory name uniqueness
- [ ] LogisticsFlux endpoint validation (expanded)
- [ ] Production line recipe compatibility
- [ ] Item flow balance warnings (underflow/overflow)
- [ ] Circular logistics detection

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

### Low Priority

#### Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è BASIC
- [x] Box<dyn Error> in public API
- [ ] Custom error types (SatisflowError enum)
- [ ] Structured error messages
- [ ] Error context propagation
- [ ] User-friendly error descriptions

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

## Phase 2: WASM Integration üìÖ PLANNED

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Complete Phase 1 persistence layer
- [ ] Ensure no threading in core engine
- [ ] Test all calculations are deterministic

### Tasks
- [ ] wasm-bindgen annotations
- [ ] JS-friendly API wrapper
- [ ] WASM build configuration
- [ ] Memory management optimization
- [ ] Panic handling for WASM
- [ ] Performance profiling

**Status**: Not started  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

## Phase 3: Vue.js UI üìÖ PLANNED

See `brief.md` for UI specifications.

### Core Views
- [ ] Dashboard view (global overview)
- [ ] Factory view (production lines, raw inputs, power)
- [ ] Logistics view (transport management)

**Status**: Design phase  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks

## Known Issues

### Critical üî¥
None currently

### Major üü†
1. **No persistence**: Users cannot save/load their factory designs
2. **No power tracking**: Power generators not implemented
3. **Sequential IDs**: Risk of collisions in distributed scenarios

### Minor üü°
1. **Limited error messages**: Errors lack context for debugging
2. **No overflow warnings**: System doesn't warn about item imbalances
3. **Missing factory deletion**: Cannot remove factories once created

## Technical Debt

1. **Documentation**: Missing inline docs for many public APIs
2. **Integration tests**: Only unit tests exist, no end-to-end tests
3. **Examples**: No example usage in codebase
4. **Benchmarks**: No performance benchmarks established
5. **CI/CD**: No automated testing pipeline

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Implement RawInput system** - Unblocks realistic factory modeling
2. **Add PowerGenerator** - Completes core game mechanics
3. **Build persistence layer** - Enables save/load functionality
4. **Improve ID management** - Prevents future bugs
5. **Create integration tests** - Validates system behavior
6. **Add WASM support** - Prepares for UI integration
7. **Start Vue.js UI** - Makes tool usable by end users
