# Satisflow Engine Factory Example Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive factory example for the Satisflow engine that demonstrates all major features of the system. The example creates 5 specialized factories with diverse production chains, raw inputs, power generators, and a logistics network connecting them all.

## Implementation Details

### Factory Structure

1. **Northern Forest - Smelting Hub**
   - Raw inputs: Iron ore, Copper ore, Limestone
   - 11 production lines covering basic smelting and processing
   - Coal power generation

2. **Central Assembly - Manufacturing Hub**
   - 11 production lines for advanced components
   - Fuel power generation
   - No raw inputs (purely assembly from imported materials)

3. **Oil Refinery - Petroleum Hub**
   - Raw inputs: Crude oil, Water
   - 7 production lines for petroleum processing
   - Fuel power generation

4. **Steel Mill - Heavy Industry**
   - Raw inputs: Iron ore, Coal, Limestone, Bauxite
   - 9 production lines for steel and construction materials
   - Coal power generation

5. **Electronics Lab - High-Tech Hub**
   - Raw inputs: Caterium ore, Raw quartz, Sulfur
   - 11 production lines for high-tech components
   - Fuel power generation

### Logistics Network

The factories are connected through a comprehensive logistics network:

- **4 Bus connections**: Conveyor buses for high-volume item transport
- **2 Train connections**: Heavy material transport between major factories
- **3 Truck connections**: Specialized item transport for specific needs

### Production Lines

Each production line demonstrates different features:
- Basic recipes with standard machines
- Overclocked machines
- Machines with Somersloops for production boosts
- Different machine types (Constructors, Assemblers, Manufacturers, Refineries, Foundries)

### Power Generation

The example includes different power generator types:
- Coal generators (Northern Forest, Steel Mill)
- Fuel generators (Central Assembly, Oil Refinery, Electronics Lab)
- Each with different clock speeds and fuel consumption rates

### Raw Inputs

The example demonstrates various raw input types:
- Miner Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 for solid resources
- Oil Extractor for crude oil
- Water Extractor for water
- Different purity levels (Impure, Normal, Pure)

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:

1. **Factory Creation**: All factories are created correctly with proper names and descriptions
2. **Production Lines**: Each factory has the expected number of production lines
3. **Raw Inputs**: Factories have the correct raw inputs with proper extraction rates
4. **Power Generators**: Each factory has appropriate power generation
5. **Logistics Connections**: All logistics connections are properly established
6. **Item Balance Calculation**: The system correctly calculates item balances across all factories
7. **Power Balance Calculation**: The system correctly calculates power generation and consumption
8. **Factory Interdependencies**: Factories properly send and receive materials through logistics

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```rust
use satisflow_engine::examples::create_sample_factory_setup;

// Create a complete factory setup
let mut engine = create_sample_factory_setup();

// Update to calculate item balances and power consumption
let global_items = engine.update();

// Get power statistics
let power_stats = engine.global_power_stats();
```

### Demo Usage

```rust
use satisflow_engine::examples::run_factory_demo;

// Run a demonstration that prints factory information
run_factory_demo();
```
