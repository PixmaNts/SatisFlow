- Global item aggregation across all factories
- Input/output balance tracking
- Surplus/deficit identification
- Complex item flow through logistics network

**Test Coverage**:

- Demo program shows real-time item balances

### ✅ 7. Power Statistics

**Implementation**: [`engine.global_power_stats()`](example_usage.rs:60)

- Total power generation and consumption
- Per-factory power balance
- Power surplus/deficit tracking
- Generator efficiency calculations

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_power_balance_calculation` - Validates power statistics
- Demo program displays comprehensive power data

### ✅ 8. Complex Production Chains

**Implementation**: Multi-factory setup with interdependencies

- Basic materials (iron, copper) → Intermediate components → Advanced products
- Cross-factory dependencies through logistics
- Realistic production ratios
- Complex material flow visualization

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_factory_interdependencies` - Ensures factories depend on each other
- Item balance tests verify complex chains work

### ✅ 9. Type Safety and Validation

**Implementation**: Throughout the codebase

- Compile-time recipe validation
- Machine type compatibility checks
- Overclock range validation (0-250%)
- Somersloop limit enforcement per machine type
- Resource-extractor compatibility validation

**Test Coverage**:
- All factory creation tests implicitly validate type safety
- Production line tests verify machine configurations

### ✅ 10. Comprehensive API Usage

**Implementation**: All major engine APIs are used

- `SatisflowEngine` main orchestrator
- Factory CRUD operations
- Logistics line creation with validation
- Production line management
- Power generator management
- Global statistics APIs

**Test Coverage**:
- Test program exercises all major APIs
- Demo shows practical API usage

## Quantitative Verification

### Scale of Example

- **Factories**: 5 specialized factories
- **Production Lines**: 49 total production lines across all factories
- **Raw Inputs**: 12 different raw material extraction points
- **Power Generators**: 5 power generation facilities
- **Logistics Connections**: 9 transport connections (buses, trains, trucks)
- **Items Tracked**: 57 different items in global balance
- **Total Power**: 2,400 MW generation, 2,232.7 MW consumption

### Complexity Demonstrated

1. **Multi-tier production**: Raw materials → Basic components → Advanced products
2. **Cross-factory logistics**: Materials transported between specialized factories
3. **Power management**: Balanced power generation across the network
4. **Realistic ratios**: Production rates match game mechanics
5. **Mixed transport**: Demonstrates all transport types effectively
